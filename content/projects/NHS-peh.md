Led the development of a product to enable clinicians from different parts of Urgent and Emergency Care to view information about patient encounters in other care settings in order to help diagnose complex cases, reassure patients, build rapport, and to identify worsening conditions. This was developed in a user centred way using Discovery to understand patient and clinical needs and Alpha to iteratively prototype and explore technical options.
