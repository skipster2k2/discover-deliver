Exploring how to improve referrals  and decision making to accredited programmes. Behavioural programmes offered to prisoners in custody and on probation designed to help with reintegration into society.

I led a multidisciplinary team through discovery to beta.I helped the team archive a ‘met’ in the alpha assessment for the first time, using my experience of previous assessments to guide the team to success. I have navigated internal MOJ processes to understand how to get things done, which processes are absolute ‘must haves’ to be done, and what can be challenged to help us move at pace.

I was responsible for communicating to a large stakeholder group about project progress and supporting the product manager to ensure we’re clear about what our priorities are, what will get delivered, and importantly, what won’t get delivered immediately and why.
