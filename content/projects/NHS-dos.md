The Directory of services is the list of all emergency care settings where healthcare professionals can refer patients. It is imperative the information is kept up to date and accurate to ensure that patients get to the right care setting before their condition worsens. I worked with stakeholders and commissioners to understand strategy intent and goals. Understanding user needs to ensure our product meets them. Setting team priorities and ensuring value is delivered. Being the ‘voice of the product’ to the wider organisation.The main focus was on how to improve the quality of emergency dental referral information in the DoS.
