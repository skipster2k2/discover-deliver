I led a delivery team in the flood digital programme. Doing a discovery into how to introduce more methods for flood hydrology into working practice. Advocating for user centred design practices in a team new to agile practices. Constructively challenging scope to ensure we consider the whole end to end service. Mapping service journeys based on user research. 
It required me to advocate for user centred practices and to frame discovery as due-diligence, providing assurance that a benchmark system is what is needed. Through a combination of research, service mapping and coaching; I was able to reframe the objectives to 3 much clearer opportunities to explore in alpha.
