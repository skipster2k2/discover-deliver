Supporting BT implementing a new Product Operating Model aimed at bringing digital and business people closer together aligned around products and services. A large complex transformation involving multiple stakeholders and delivery partners.

My role is frontrunner lead, supporting and coaching the first tribe established in this model. I lead a team defining, testing, and documenting ways of working. I created and taught a series of masterclasses focused on modern product management and delivery practices, focused on the mindset changes needed to make the transformation a success. I objectively feedback what is working and what could be improved as the Operating Model is implemented.
